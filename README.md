# T3 Arena Cheat Codes unlimited t-gems and t-coins Hacks tutorial

T3 Arena Cheat Codes unlimited t-gems and t-coins Hacks tutorial - For this project, we will take raidon as an example. Leiden is equipped with a powerful shotgun and a more destructive shotgun. To supplement his ability, try to give him some skills so that he can attack the enemy from a distance. Skills like bullet storm or Razer can help him score from a greater distance. If not, try some skills, such as bubble prison or drone chain, to prevent the enemy from escaping. Skill sets can easily change. You can conduct these experiments in the practice mode, or you can conduct experiments on field subjects in the actual competition. Finding the right pair for your character is trial and error, so patience is a must. There is no doubt that in T3 arena, if you stick with your friends, you are more likely to survive or win scuffles with the enemy. You can not only work together, but also take care of each other, cover each other, and even help your important members escape (for example, someone with a battery or a superstar).
